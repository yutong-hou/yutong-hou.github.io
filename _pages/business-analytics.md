For this project, the objective is to analyze tweets from the past dataset in order to predict the tweets’ emotions with processing the ‘complaint 1700’ and ‘non-complaint 1700’ files, i.e., negative or non-negative through using machine learning models.

Firstly, I removed punctuation characters and stop words. And then trained three models and selected Random Forest Model which yields the highest prediction accuracy.

Lastly, I applied the model on the test dataset and resulted in accuracy around 0.76.

[Conjoint Analysis – Toy Horse Product Line Strategy](https://yutong-hou.github.io/files/Conjoint Analysis-Toy Horse.pdf)

The goal is to make recommendations about the toy horse product line. 

Firstly, we used regression to estimate the conjoint model at the individual level. Then explored the best market segmentations by conducting priori segmentation analysis and post-hoc clustering. Finally, we simulated market shares for different product-line scenarios and identified the best possible product line strategy given considerations related to competitive response, cannibalization, profitability and long-run performance.
