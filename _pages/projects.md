[Bank Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/diwu437/diwu-github.io/blob/master/Bank_customer_churn_prediction.ipynb)

In this project, I use supervised learning models to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future. Furthermore, I will analyze top factors that influence user retention. 
I have transformed gender and geography varibles to binary varibles to enhance model performance. And then i have standardized features for the same purpose.
Based on the Accuracy socre, i picked Logistic regression as my final model with its best hyperparameters.
Identified Age as the primary facotr that effect churn rate based on feature importance.

[Document clustering and topic modeling](https://github.com/diwu437/diwu-github.io/blob/master/Document_Clustering_and_Topic_Modeling_ipynb%E2%80%9D.ipynb)

In this project, I used unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups and identify their latent topics/structures.
The data consist over 900k customer reviews from a watch retailer. 
For the first goal, I grouped customer reviews with k-means by their TF-IDF. Then I will select 6 most important words with highest importance. The “importance” here refer to highest TF-IDF which come from the center of each cluster. 
For the second goal, I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to find latent topics and assign them to each document. Lastly, I selected top 14 key words for each topics.

[Lanuching a new product with kiwi](https://diwu437.github.io/files/Lanuching a new product with kiwi.pdf)

In this project, we are supposed to do the profit maximization with multi-segment and multi-product for the sake of analyzing the best pricing strategy for the new product “Kiwi Bubbles”. Under the assumption that the unit costs are all $0.5 and market size is 1000 consumers, the data set we had records the choices of soft drink of 359 consumers over the course of 3 years. More details about how we manipulated the logit model are as follows.

[Tweetier](https://diwu437.github.io/files/text classification.pdf)


The goal of final project is using the 'complaint1700' and 'non-complaint1700' file to train a robust classification model, which can be used afterwards to test if a new tweet is negative and help the company to separate the non-negative tweets. 

I start by removing punctuation characters and stop words. And the trained three models and selected Native Bayes model which yields the highest predicting accuracy.  

Lastly, I applied the model on the test dataset and resulting in accuracy around 77%.
